# Angular Homes App

This repository contains my implementation of the Angular Homes App tutorial from the Angular team. This project serves as a foundation for learning Angular and demonstrating my coding skills. I plan to enhance this project with my own features and improvements upon completion of the tutorial.

## Current Status

I am currently working through the Angular Homes App tutorial. Below are the next steps and planned enhancements:

### Planned Enhancements

- [ ] Complete the Angular Homes App tutorial.
- [ ] Add custom filtering options for homes (e.g., price range, location).
- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Enhance the UI/UX with additional styling and responsive design.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a live server (GitHub Pages).
